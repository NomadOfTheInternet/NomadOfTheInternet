    <td>We were told this lesson that we would be getting up to speed with our binary encryption work from last lesson and looking into how to make it case sensitive. As I finished the baseline work last lesson I moved straight on to figuring out how to make it case sensitive. I used this independence well, and this really allowed me to get some solid work done, and by the end of the lesson I really felt like I understood what I had researched independently.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Despite my aforementioned hard work and independent understanding of my new knowledge, by the end I realised that the entirely new system I used was still not case sensitive, despite that being the entire aim. But rather than independently pursuing a solution to this, I simply waited for the teacher to come around, and he simply said that he did not know what the problem was and would have to look into it later. These last few minutes of the lesson were ultimately wasted as I could have been independently looking for a solution to my problem.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As mentioned above, in future I should try harder to come up with independent solutions for unknown problems. I cannot always rely on the teacher, and as was shown in the lesson today it does not always work. This was a valuable lesson in the use of more independent thinking and problem solving.</td>
