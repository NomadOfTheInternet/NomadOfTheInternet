    <td>The lesson started with me quickly working out a simple solution to my problem from last lesson. This meant that I was finished, and could easily translate the message that Mr. Tansley put on Classroom. This meant that I didn't technically need to do anything for the rest of the lesson, but keeping my previous targets in mind I made sure to use this time efficiently in order to polish up my spreadsheet and generally make it look nicer. This allowed the lesson to be much more productive than it otherwise would have been and this reflection on my targets allowed me to do so.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>While I did make the extra effort to improve my spreadsheet, the improvements I did make could have had more thought put into them. I generally just did what I did for my last spreadsheet, and added some blue to make it look smoother. I feel I could have put more thought and innovation into my design improvements overall.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As mentioned above, next lesson I will try and put more thought into my improvements. Reflection is a very important part of learning, and incorporating it will allow me to get much further on my personal projects.</td>
