    <td>The lesson began with Mr. Tansley swiftly getting back to where we were last lesson, and continuing in advancing our knowledge on using Google Sheets for encryption. He reminded us of the minor addition we had made last week using the CONCATENATE function, before posing the question of how we could de-concatenate something, i.e. space a message over multiple boxes. We had an active class discussion about this, in which I participated well, which allowed me to retain the information much better than I otherwise would have if I had just sat and listened. This allowed me to remember what I needed to know as we replicated this work in our own encryption sheets.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>

    <td>While this lesson did go well for me, I feel there was one aspect which could have been done better. After the class discussion, when we were told to work, for the above reasons I completed this work very quickly, and as there was only 1 teacher helping a class of many, some people around me were asking for help. As I had nothing better to do, I could have assisted them (not by telling them what to do or doing it for them, but by hinting at it and providing them with the information with which they can work it out for themselves). However, I did not give them very much help at all, and this meant that I missed out an opportunity to further improve my understanding and retention of this new knowledge by imparting it to someone else.</td>

    <td>As mentioned above, in future I will try to help people more often. This will allow me to come to a greater understanding of the topics about which I am learning, and really get familiar with it in order for my long term retention of it to further improve.</td>
