    <td>The lesson began with us being told that we would be handing in our encryption sheets at the end of the lesson. After this, there was a quick recap of what we needed to have on it, and then we were told to finish and hand it in. Since there were no new things introduced in this lesson, I had no required things to do. However, some of my previous lesson targets had been to do more optional work when finished what is required, so I did that. I improved general visibility and increased my maximum character length, and this did take up a sizable amount of the lesson. I have made a few targets in the past, but it is rare that the next lesson gives you the perfect opportunity to put them into action. It did happen this week though, and I feel I used it well and this incorporation of my previous target allowed me to do better in my learning.</td>

    <td>Despite the above mentioned addition of new, optional extras, I feel what could be improved is the quality and type of extras. While I added plenty of things to make the spreadsheet function better (such as an increased character count), I feel I could have taken into consideration the look of my spreadsheet. While not completely white, it was mostly quite bland and I feel I could have used this lesson to improve upon the look of my spreadsheet as well as the utility.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As mentioned above, my target for the future is to take looks into account more in future projects, rather than purely focusing on the utility. While utility is important and should come first, it is still important to take the time to consider how I could make my work look better.</td>
