    <td>The lesson began with Mr. Tansley swiftly getting back to where we were last lesson, and continuing in advancing our knowledge on using Google Sheets for encryption. He recapped everything we had done so far, and told us that we needed to get up to speed. He also taught us how to use the CONCATENATE command, and I took in the information well. I engaged well in the lesson and generally participated well. This allowed the lesson to go very smoothly and providing the class with answers allowed the information on Google Sheets to stay in my long term memory for longer.</td>

    <td>While this lesson did go well for me, I feel there was one aspect which could have been done better. While most of the lesson was general class recap and getting up to speed, we were given 15 minutes at the end to make sure we had everything and to generally polish it up. While I did add the new things that were required, after I had finished I resorted to going idle rather than taking the initiative and polishing my table and generally making it look nicer. I could have used this time much more efficiently and my encryption table could have been generally nicer around the edges if I had put in the extra effort.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As mentioned above, in future I will try to go the extra mile whenever possible rather than doing only what is required and then being idle. While it does get me through the lesson, it would be much more beneficial for my learning to do as much as I can in the time given to me.</td>
