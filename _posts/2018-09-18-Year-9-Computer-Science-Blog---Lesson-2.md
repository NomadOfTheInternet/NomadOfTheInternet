    <td>The lesson began with Mr. Tansley swiftly getting back to where we were last lesson, and showing us the solution to the problem he had asked us to think about. I listened well, and remembered the new knowledge for the next thing he told us to do, which was replicate what he had shown, but looking nicer and with more functions. I got through this work efficiently, as I kept my target from last lesson in mind in order to move forward with my independent skills. This greatly helped, and this self evaluation is something I should apply more often to my learning. This took up a good part of the lesson, and I spent the rest of the lesson making it generally look nicer and using my initiative to think of improvements. Overall, this lesson went very well for me.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>While this lesson did go well for me, I feel I could have paid slightly more attention to the examples given my Mr. Tansley. As he was showing us things on the board, I got the gist of what he was getting across, but I frequently missed the finer steps and had to ask for help from those around me. This slowed me down somewhat and I could have gotten through more work if I had just paid slightly closer attention to what Mr. Tansley was saying.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As mentioned above, in future I will try to pay more attention to the finer aspects of new things as they are being told to me. While needing to look these up isn't terrible, it would still make me much more efficient if I paid more attention and took in more information the first time. This will allow me to get through my work much more efficiently in the long run.</td>
