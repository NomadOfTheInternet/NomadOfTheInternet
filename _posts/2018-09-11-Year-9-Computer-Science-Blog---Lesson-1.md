    <td>The lesson began with Mr. Tansley introducing himself, and telling us about how the subject works in this new academic year, and told us that we would be mastering programs such as Excel, as they have many uses and practical applications for many different situations. We did not do much independent work this lesson as almost all of it was listening to the teacher, but I did well to listen and stay engaged for a long period of time, concentrating on the information we were being given, participating well in class discussions and being the first to solve an encryption problem on the board, demonstrating that I was actively thinking for myself throughout the lesson, and not just being a passive observer. This allowed me to make the most of this introductory lesson, an overall good start to the year.</td>

    <td>While for the majority of the lesson I did do well to both listen and actively participate, during the small amount of independent work we did do I feel as though I could have put in more effort. We were given a problem to solve in Excel (encrypting a message using a shift cipher), and I could have tried harder to think outside the box and make better progress. Instead I ended up trying the first few simple things I came up with, and then essentially giving up. This is not a positive attitude to independent work, and my learning suffered for it, as this was the only opportunity to do an independent task and I ended up not coming out with anything to show for it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As mentioned above, in future I will try to work harder to think of more outside the box solutions to problems independently. This will greatly improve my learning experience as being able to work independently is a major part of the Learning @ Challoners model, and developing my skill in independent problem solving will allow me to advance much quicker as we are set more independent tasks throughout the year.</td>
