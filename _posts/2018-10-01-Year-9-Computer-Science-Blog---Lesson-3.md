(add details to "Lesson Review") </td>

    <td>The lesson began with Mr. Tansley swiftly getting back to where we were last lesson, and continuing in advancing our knowledge on using Google Sheets for encryption. He showed us how to get the proper table of letters to encrypt using "vlookup", and hinted that we should try to add a decrypting function as well. I got through the table very quickly, and moved onto adding decryption. I worked very well using independence (part of Learning @ Challoners) and thus advanced sufficiently for the lesson. This skill is often very useful in all forms of work and I fortunately used it well this lesson.</td>

    <td>While this lesson did go well for me, I feel there was one aspect which could have been done better. Mr. Tansley told us that we also needed to incorporate spaces as part of our encryption in order to make the code harder to crack, but I forgot to put them into my table. I thought this would be unimportant but it became a big problem for me later on. It certainly hindered my experience later in the lesson as I had to go back and redo it, taking up more of my time than it should have. Doing it how I should have done the first time would have allowed me to get through even more in the lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As mentioned above, in future I will try to do everything exactly as I am supposed to, without making any lazy emissions, as these can hurt you in the long run, as I learned this lesson. By making sure I am always as accurate as possible the first time, I can get through even more work each lesson and thus learn more.</td>
