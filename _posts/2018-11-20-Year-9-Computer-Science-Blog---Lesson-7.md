    <td>We were told this lesson that we would be doing encryption for binary, hexadecimal and other number systems using html code. We did not do much independent work this lesson as almost all of it was listening to the teacher, but I did well to listen and stay engaged for a long period of time, concentrating on the information we were being given and participating well in class. I also did well to apply this to my independent work as well.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As mentioned above, the lesson went very well for me, but towards the end when I had done what I had been asked, I noticed that my encryption method was not case sensitive due to the vlookup command not being case sensitive. Rather than pursuing an answer to this, I did nothing for the last 5 minutes of the lesson. This attitude to independent learning prevented me from getting a headstart on next lesson's work.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As mentioned above, next lesson it is important that I go beyond just what I have been told and look at my work to see what I can improve independently, utilising the Reflection aspect of Learning @ Challoners. This is a very important part of learning, as it allows me to progress further and increase my depth of knowledge.</td>
